# README.md
first step was to import the random module, to create a random generator for the list. I did that with import random

next was to list out all the names. I did names=("name inputs")

next i wrote out the variable x and assigned the variable to random.choice(names). This is what would help me randomly generate the list of names

finally, I just printed the X variable to print out all the names.

I tried adding another function to remove a name if you already picked it but I couldn't figure it how.
